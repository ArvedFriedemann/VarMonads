VarMonads is a project from my PhD Thesis that aims to make search features like unit propagation, branching and clause learning available to general programming languages. 
More context and documentation can be found in my PhD thesis (that is currently under review but can hopefully be published soon).

A quick overview over the files:

Assembly/Examples contains examples showcasing the running features of the system.

BasicVarMonads      contains basic definitions of the different VarMonads. It also contains some simple constructions to create new VarMonads from basic ones.
SpecialVarMonads    contains VarMonads with additional features, like branching or clause learning
Assembly            contains a concrete assembly of a running system
